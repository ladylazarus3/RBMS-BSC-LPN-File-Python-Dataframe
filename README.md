# RBMS-BSC-LPN-File-Python-Dataframe
The script's purpose is to check each record for existing MARC 260/264 subfield $a values and 008 MARC Country Code value against a dataframe version of the RBMS/BSC Latin Place Names File, supply normalized geographic data in the MARC 752 field when possible, and output the results into three separate spreadsheets for review.
